NAME
    Email::Store::Thread - Store threading information for a mail

ABSTRACT
    Remember to create the database table:

        % make install
        % perl -MEmail::Store="..." -e 'Email::Store->setup'

    And now:

        my $container = $mail->container;
        if ($container->parent) {
            print "Parent of this message is ".$container->parent->message;
        }

  DESCRIPTION
    This adds to a mail the concept of a thread container. A thread
    container is a node in a tree which represents the thread of an email
    conversation. It plugs into the indexing process and works out where in
    the tree the mail belongs; you can then ask a mail for its "container",
    a container for its "message", and for its "parent", "child" and
    "sibling" containers, which are used to navigate the thread tree.

    This is distributed separately from the main "Email::Store" distribution
    as it tends to slow down indexing somewhat.
